a Trello board multiplexer for sprint planning awesomeness

To-do
===

Application
* use local storage for user settings and caching api requests
* bootstrap for badges, alerts
* per-story lists
* collapsey card stacks

Infrastructure
* make this a proper node.js project with package management via npm and bower
* do less and coffeescript compilation on the server side so we can get decent 
* linting, minification, and .map files
* enable serving it with node, as having to configure IIS to add mimetypes for .coffee and .less files is a pain
* unit tests
